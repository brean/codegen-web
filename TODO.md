# required next steps
- read code from yaml (drag-and-drop/"upload")
- render positions using dagree
- create new classes, variables, ...

# Ideas for future features
- Include a text-editor (monacco)
  - select language (python/yaml/...)
- export AST to other languages
- python CLI to create code
  - use pyscript to generate code (maybe to expensive?)
